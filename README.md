## Proof Assistants

Proof Assistants will not be used as they themselves are not TC.
Thus, they will not be helpful towards the end goal of my Thesis.
They were fun to explore and understand, as by the end I was able to uyse what I learned about TC and see where they fell short.

### Coq

Currently using Coq for proofs for the thesis.

### Dafny

Might look into Dafny in the future.

### TLA+

TLA+ is more suited for State machines and simultaneous computing.
Thus, I won't really be looking at it much more.
