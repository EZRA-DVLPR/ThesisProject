## DrawIO

DrawIO is a tool to draw and design diagrams for many different applications.
There exists a downloadable version and a web version.

## JFLAP

JFLAP is a tool to model state machines.
I utilize it in the thesis to demonstrate a simplistic state machine.
It's pretty powerful and useful for automata theory.

## Proof Assistants

Proof Assistants will not be used as they themselves are not TC.
Thus, they will not be helpful towards the end goal of my Thesis.
They were fun to explore and understand, as by the end I was able to uyse what I learned about TC and see where they fell short.

### Coq

No longer using Coq for proofs for the thesis.

### Dafny

No longer will look into Dafny in the future.

### TLA+

TLA+ is more suited for State machines and simultaneous computing.
Thus, I won't really be looking at it much more.
