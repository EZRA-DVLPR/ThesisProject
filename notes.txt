research is not in the lecturer job description

lecturer is just there to teach classes
OG intention was to cover classes that other faculty were unable to teach. Temporary positions.
In practice this is not true

lecturers generally have very little to no power in terms of institutional direction
	-> just to sit there and cannot vote in meetings
	->'Not one of us' mentality

Generally, lecturers are not referred to as professors

considered 2nd class citizens implicitly

more likely at a community college to obtain lecturer position as master degree holder
	-> only teaching no research at all

read paper in and out and get a solid question to work with. get them to talk about it.
	-> have to ask a really good question.


assistant professors. Newer faculty tend to be more research focused. 

having a publication looks really good.

interactions with ppl at institutions where i might apply.
