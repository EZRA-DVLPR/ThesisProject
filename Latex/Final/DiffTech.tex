\section{Different Proof Techniques for demonstrating Turing Completeness}

\subsection{Turing Complete Proofs Overview}

All proofs are equivalent in goal.
The difference lies in their usability for specific domains.



\subsection{Computer Engineering}

\subsubsection{Gates \& Wiring}

NOR, ADDER, OR, NOT gates


\subsection{Computer Science}

\subsubsection{State Machines}

\subsubsubsection{Formal Technical Writing}

$\lambda \gamma \tau $ etc. being used to describe TC

\subsubsubsection{Gamified Writing}

$\lambda \gamma \tau $ etc. being used to describe TC, but based on a very verbose and interactive style

\subsubsection{Software Implementation}

Demonstrate an example of a problem/scenario which shows TC.

\subsubsubsection{Conway's Game of Life}

Classic example to implement

\subsubsubsection{Rule 110}

Simpler example to implement

\subsubsubsection{Calculator with Store Value}

More challenging to implement than the previous two.


\subsubsection{Interpreter for TC lang}

Implement an interpreter for a known TC language in a given language.

\subsubsubsection{Brainfuck}

Describe Brainfuck

\subsubsubsection{C}

Is C TC?

Show how this


\subsection{Mathematics}

\subsubsection{Lambda Calculus}

Whatever the fuck this is, is TC
