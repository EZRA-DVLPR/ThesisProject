\chapter{Different Approaches for Proofs to Demonstrate Turing Completeness}

\section{Turing Complete Proofs Overview}

We will be exploring the different approaches to demonstrate TC

All proofs are equivalent in goal.
The difference lies in their usability for specific domains.

\section{Computer Engineering}

\subsection{Logical Design from a perspective of physical requirements}

Gates \& Wiring
NOR, ADDER, OR, NOT gates

\section{Computer Science}

\subsection{State Machines}

\subsubsection{Formal Technical Writing}

$\lambda \gamma \tau $ etc. being used to describe TC

\subsubsection{Gamified Writing}

$\lambda \gamma \tau $ etc. being used to describe TC, but based on a very verbose and interactive style

\subsection{Software Implementation}

Demonstrate an example of a problem/scenario which shows TC.

\subsubsection{Conway's Game of Life}

Classic example to implement

\subsubsection{Rule 110}

Simpler example to implement

\subsubsection{Calculator with Store Value}

More challenging to implement than the previous two.

\subsection{Interpreter for a known Turing Complete language}

Implement an interpreter for a known TC language in a given language.
Must faithfully and accurately simulate the behavior of the given language to be interpreted.

typically, we will implement a simple TC language such as brainfuck

\section{Mathematics}

\subsection{Lambda Calculus}

Basically a simplistic view of math functions.
can be shown as TC through construction of certain concepts.
