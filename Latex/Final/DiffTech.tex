\chapter{Different Proof Techniques for demonstrating Turing Completeness}

\section{Turing Complete Proofs Overview}

We will be exploring the different approaches to demonstrate TC

All proofs are equivalent in goal.
The difference lies in their usability for specific domains.

\section{Computer Engineering}

\subsection{Gates \& Wiring}

NOR, ADDER, OR, NOT gates

\section{Computer Science}

\subsection{State Machines}

\subsubsection{Formal Technical Writing}

$\lambda \gamma \tau $ etc. being used to describe TC

\subsubsection{Gamified Writing}

$\lambda \gamma \tau $ etc. being used to describe TC, but based on a very verbose and interactive style

\subsection{Software Implementation}

Demonstrate an example of a problem/scenario which shows TC.

\subsubsection{Conway's Game of Life}

Classic example to implement

\subsubsection{Rule 110}

Simpler example to implement

\subsubsection{Calculator with Store Value}

More challenging to implement than the previous two.

\subsection{Interpreter for TC lang}

Implement an interpreter for a known TC language in a given language.

\subsubsection{Brainfuck}

Describe Brainfuck

\subsubsection{C}

Is C TC?

Show how this

\section{Mathematics}

\subsection{Lambda Calculus}

Whatever the fuck this is, is TC
