\chapter{Proteus is Turing Complete}

This section will describe how we will construct 1+ proofs for showing that Proteus is TC.

\section{The Proteus Grammar}

List out the grammar and describe how it can be read, line by line.
Probably have a small example of a program that shows most of (maybe all) of the functionality with Proteus

\section{Initial Thoughts based off of the grammar}

List out some ideas that led to the idea that Proteus could be TC

\section{Proof Outline}

Theorems that would be used
Steps for proof outline

\section{Proof v1}

Formal proof that follows the outline

\section{Implementing Rule 110}

Implementation of Rule 110 that is a demonstration of TC.
