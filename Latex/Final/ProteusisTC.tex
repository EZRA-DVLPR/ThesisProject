\chapter{Proteus is Turing Complete}\label{chapter:ProteusTC}

This section will describe how we will construct the proof showing that Proteus is TC.

\section{Useful information to be used in the proof}

First, I will discuss features about Proteus programs on a theoretical level.
Then, I will discuss features about the Proteus language that allows for the creation of a TM.
This information is the background information that will guide the construction of the proof outline and the proof itself.

\subsection{Undecidable input}

Because Proteus is a higher-level programming language, we can leverage the usage of Rice's Theorem, Theorem \ref{thm:RiceThm}.
Thus, given any input it is impossible to determine an answer to the Halting Problem.
Furthermore, one cannot determine if there is an actor that will be told to switch to a particular state.
By determining that any given Proteus program is undecidable, I will look at how to create a TM.

\subsection{Requirements of a TM}

In this section, I will point out critical pieces of Proteus that prove useful to create a TM.
Recall the proteus grammar seen in section \ref{subsec:ProteusGrammar}.
We can see...

Analyze the grammar to see what would allow for a TC system.

\section{Proof Outline}

By showing that any input to Proteus is undecidable and creating a TM, I can show that Proteus is TC.
This leverages the usage of both the Church-Turing Thesis, Theorem \ref{thm:CTT}, and Rice's Theorem, Theorem \ref{thm:RiceThm}.

I will outline the explicit definitions of a TM with, seen in \ref{subsec:AutomataThy}.

Then I will explicitly show how to implement Rule 110 in Proteus using the same explicit definition of a TM.
I will also show it implemented in Proteus code itself.

Lastly, I will show an interpreter for brainfuck using Proteus, also written in formal language.

\section{Proof}

Formal proof that follows the outline.

Must recall that the inputs are undecidable and we are creating a TM => Proteus is TC.

\section{Implementing Rule 110}

Implementation of Rule 110 that is a demonstration of TC.

\section{Interpreter for Brainfuck}

EN - I dont think i will do this one, but I leave it as an option.
