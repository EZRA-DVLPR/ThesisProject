\chapter{Proteus is Turing Complete}\label{chapter:ProteusTC}

This section will describe how we will construct the proof(s) for showing that Proteus is TC.

\section{Initial Thoughts based off of the grammar}

Recall the proteus grammar

Analyze the grammar to see what would allow for a TC system.

\section{Proof Outline}

Theorems that would be used
Steps for proof outline

\section{Proof v1}

Formal proof that follows the outline.
describes the state transitions, state machine, given problem is undecidable.

\section{Implementing Rule 110}

Implementation of Rule 110 that is a demonstration of TC.
