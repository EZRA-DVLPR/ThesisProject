%i copied part of the other abstract from one of the sample theses. I can reword if need be.

Programming languages are provably Turing Complete.
Proofs showing a given system is Turing Complete come in many varieties depending on the discipline and perspective of the system.
Proteus is a programming language developed for the Autonomy Research Center for STEAHM at California State University, Northridge in collaboration with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
This thesis looks into different methods of demonstrating a given system is Turing Complete and applying them to Proteus.
After completing the proof, there is a reflection of the methods discussed and utilized.
